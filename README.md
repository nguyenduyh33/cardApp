# Card-App

This application is written in Javascript using some ES6 features to demonstrate the ability to build, shuffle, and sort a standard deck of 52 playing cards.  Jasmine and Karma are used as the respective testing framework and test runner.  Eslint is also used following the airbnb style guide (with a few exceptions) to help keep myself in check :sweat:
